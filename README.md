# Blogging Application with Recommendation System and Text Summarization

Welcome to our blogging application GitHub repository! This project is built using Node.js and Express for the backend, along with additional features such as user authentication, blog recommendation based on cosine similarity, text summarization using Hugging Face, and a RESTful API developed using FASTAPI. MongoDB with Mongoose is used for all CRUD operations related to the database.

## Features

- **Blog CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete blogs. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing blog posts.

- **User Authentication**: The application supports user signup and sign out functionality to manage user accounts securely.

- **Blog Recommendation System**: Blogs are recommended to users based on cosine similarity, providing personalized recommendations tailored to each user's preferences.

- **Search Functionality**: Utilizing cosine similarity, the application offers a search functionality to find the most suitable blogs from the MongoDB database.

- **RESTful API Development**: The backend is powered by FASTAPI, a modern Python web framework, providing a robust and efficient API for integrating with other applications.

- **Text Summarization**: The application includes text summarization functionality using the Hugging Face library, enabling users to generate concise summaries of long texts.
